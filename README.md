Project Name: "AI-Sprint"


Agile Project Management & Task Automator


Overview:AI-Sprint is an AI-powered agile project management platform designed to
help development teams transform high-level project goals into structured, actionable
technical tasks.
The system leverages prompt engineering and AI-generated content to automatically break
down a user-defined project goal into:

• User stories

• Technical tasks

• Acceptance criteria

The platform provides a collaborative Kanban-style board where teams can manage tasks
in real time. It includes sprint planning, task tracking, and AI-assisted backlog generation.
The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

• Frontend built with React + TypeScript

• State management using Redux Toolkit

• Backend using Node.js & Express

• Database using MongoDB

Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment
AI-Sprint bridges traditional agile workflows with AI-powered automation to enhance
productivity and sprint planning efficiency.
